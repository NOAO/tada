* 2.4.0 <2016-04-14 Thu 07:50>

This updates the version numbers to match Major.Minor version of TADA puppet
code. Previous RPM version was 0.2.17

Config now read from TWO files.  One of them (/etc/tada/hiera.yaml) is
generated from puppet.  This allows hiera to be used to specify host
specific values such as the Valley that a Mountain should transfer
files to.
