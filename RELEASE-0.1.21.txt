Hotfix in support of BOK batch ingests.

- Abort ingest if *.hdr file exists under iRODS. To disable abort (but
  still warn), add "__test_resubmit=1" to personality.
- Fixed duplicate EXTNAME in bok data
- All header mods now done to PrimaryHDU and include only fields in
  defined list (try: "fitsheader baz.fits.fz | grep MODIFIED:")
