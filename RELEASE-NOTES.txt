* Release 2.5.7 <2016-06-29 Wed>
- Add instrument: ccd_imager
- change personality location to /var/tada
- add jobid_type=obsmicro for additional field in Archive filename
  using DATE-OBS microseconds (for arcoiris)
- add IRODS prefix to HDR path for call to Archive Ingest service
* Release 2.5.0 <2016-06-17 Fri>
Always trust schedule. After gaining experience using the TAC
schedule, we have come to believe it should be trusted more than the
FITS header for Propid.  However, when the schedule indicates a split
night (multiple proposals in one observing night) the schedule
necessary but not sufficient.  For split nights, we use the Propid
from the header as long is it is in the schedule for the night.  We've
added a "default" for each instrument to the schedule so that every
day does not have be entered for every instrument.  All "*trust*"
functions used in personalities ("calchdr" section) are deprecated
(they do nothing except emit warning).

Because of the strong reliance on the TAC schedule for Propid, this
release is tightly tied to the MARS schedule service. We no longer
view that service as optional.  If the schedule service is down,
Archive Ingest will be rejected.  Changes to the MARS schedule service
were made to support this release.



* Release 2.4.0 <2016-04-14 Thu 07:50>
This updates the version numbers to match Major.Minor version of TADA puppet
code. Previous RPM version was 0.2.17

Config now read from TWO files.  One of them (/etc/tada/hiera.yaml) is
generated from puppet.  This allows hiera to be used to specify host
specific values such as the Valley that a Mountain should transfer
files to.

* Release 0.2.13 <2016-03-24 Thu 14:49>
- TADA
  + lossless on-the-fly fpack for floating point images
    - If two indentical file names put in dropbox except one has fz,
      fz is submited, other ignored.
    - If one fz file put in dropbox, is submitted as is (no recompress)
    - If one non-fiz file put in dropbox, compressed lossless, submitted
  + reform all YAML files (better human readibility) 
  + regen personality table from YAMLs
  + drop fail gracefully on bad directory format
  + drop working to Mtn and Valley; name changes to reflect ("watch_drop")

- dataque
  + added function for direct programatic push of file
  + added configurable logging

* Release 0.2.11 <2016-03-18 Fri 12:28>
- Create HDR from concatenation of all HDUs (in order)
  Previously used only Primary.  For some cases of fpacked files
  this resulted in the HDR file not containing RA & DEC (etc.)

* Release 0.2.10 <2016-03-17 Thu 14:37>

- prefix table name change (triplespec -> arcoiris) and new prefix (c4ai)
- add mapping_function source fields to list of "USED_FIELDS" that may
  be updated
- add on the fly fpack for dropbox (NOT ADEQUATELY TESTED)
- improved format of YAML output from personaltiy(bash)-to-yaml
- more smoke tests (uncompressed mosaic3, arcoiris)
- removed legacy mosaic_1_1 smoke

* Release 0.2.4 <2016-02-03 Wed 07:50>
Don't modify DTACQNAM if it already has a value.

Includes replacement for LPR front-end to TADA.  Now you can submit a set
of files to TADA (on the mountain host) from anywhere with something like:

  rsync -avz --password-file ~/rsync.pwd $srcdir tada@$mtnhost::dropbox

In the above, the rsync.pwd file should have the same contents as
mtnhost:/etc/tada/rsync.pwd, should be owned by you, and should have
permissions of 0400.  Your $srcdir directory structure should match:

   <YYYYMMDD>/<instrument>/.../myfile.fits.fz
   
Where YYYYMMDD is the observation day (DTCALDAT) corressponding to the
FITS files underneath.  And <instrument> is currently one of:
  bok23m-90prime
  ct13m-andicam
  ct15m-echelle
  ct4m-cosmos
  ct4m-decam
  kp09m-hdi
  kp4m-kosmos
  kp4m-mosaic_1_1
  kp4m-mosaic3
  kp4m-newfirm
  soar-goodman
  soar-osiris
  soar-sami
  soar-soi
  soar-spartan
  wiyn-bench
  wiyn-whirc

You can tell if your files have been successfully submitted (to the
mountain TADA queue) with:

  rsync -a --password-file ~/.tada/rsync.pwd tada@$mtnhost::statusbox $mydir 
  find $mydir -type f

* Release 0.1.29 <2016-01-20 Wed 14:37>
Added service that watches for any FITS files added below
mountain:/var/tada/dropbox/.  Submits an new (or modified) files to
TADA and adds a corresponding entry in /var/tada/statusbox/ if the
submit succeeded. Currently that info isn't used but could be used to
determine which files under /var/tada/dropbox should be touch to cause
them to be submitting again.

Provisioning changes made to make Mountain and Valley machines more
nearly identical in terms of provisioning.
* Release 0.1.25 <2016-01-08 Fri 14:37>
- Obstype entry added for mosaic3
- smoke overhaul
* Release 0.1.22 <2015-12-17 Thu 14:37>
- Support dry-run (no ingest) using direct_submit; Use "  -o
  __dry_run=1" in personality

- Fix to temporary file copy on direct_submit. Previously, would be non-writable
  under some circumstances.

* Release 0.1.21 <2015-12-16 Wed 14:37>
Hotfix in support of BOK batch ingests.

- Abort ingest if *.hdr file exists under iRODS. To disable abort (but
  still warn), add "__test_resubmit=1" to personality.
- Fixed duplicate EXTNAME in bok data
- All header mods now done to PrimaryHDU and include only fields in
  defined list (try: "fitsheader baz.fits.fz | grep MODIFIED:")

* Release 0.1.18 <2015-12-07 Mon 14:37>
