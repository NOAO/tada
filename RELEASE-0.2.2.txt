Includes replacement for LPR front-end to TADA.  Now you can submit a set
of files to TADA (on the mountain host) from anywhere with something like:

  rsync -avz --password-file ~/rsync.pwd $srcdir tada@$mtnhost::dropbox

In the above, the rsync.pwd file should have the same contents as
mtnhost:/etc/tada/rsync.pwd, should be owned by you, and should have
permissions of 0400.  Your $srcdir directory structure should match:

   <YYYYMMDD>/<instrument>/.../myfile.fits.fz
   
Where YYYYMMDD is the observation day (DTCALDAT) corressponding to the
FITS files underneath.  And <instrument> is currently one of:
  bok23m-90prime
  ct13m-andicam
  ct15m-echelle
  ct4m-cosmos
  ct4m-decam
  kp09m-hdi
  kp4m-kosmos
  kp4m-mosaic_1_1
  kp4m-mosaic3
  kp4m-newfirm
  soar-goodman
  soar-osiris
  soar-sami
  soar-soi
  soar-spartan
  wiyn-bench
  wiyn-whirc

You can tell if your files have been successfully submitted (to the
mountain TADA queue) with:

  rsync -a --password-file ~/.tada/rsync.pwd tada@$mtnhost::statusbox $mydir 
  find $mydir -type f
