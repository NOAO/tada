Added service that watches for any FITS files added below
mountain:/var/tada/dropbox/.  Submits an new (or modified) files to
TADA and adds a corresponding entry in /var/tada/statusbox/ if the
submit succeeded. Currently that info isn't used but could be used to
determine which files under /var/tada/dropbox should be touch to cause
them to be submitting again.

Provisioning changes made to make Mountain and Valley machines more
nearly identical in terms of provisioning.
